        Fishbite was a nickname given to me during extracurricular activites
        outside of school! I'll disclose the reason behind it when we're sitting
        with a beer discussing your website!

            I've been involved in creating stuff for the Internet since around
            2000 AD when I first had the idea of taking a stand-alone piece of
            software written for MS Windows&trade; onto the World Wide Web!
            These were fairly early days for the web and everything, browsers,
            JavaScript, CSS were in their infancy. The software in question was
            used to measure the printing characteristics of commercial printing
            presses, and subsequently provide a <em>"correction"</em> that made
            the press print to a defined standard.
          </p>

          <p>
            We employed and worked with programmers to do the coding that made
            our applications 'do their stuff' and I used a very early product
            call 'Frogbuilder'&trade; to build application front ends for the
            printing industry. It was created by a commpany by the name of
            Frogtrade&trade; who now specialise in eductional software:
            <a href="https://www.frogeducation.com/" target="_blank"
              >frogeducation.com</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            The applications we built were used by commercial printers to
            guarantee that their clients' final printed product would be the
            exact colours they were expecting. This was really cutting edge
            stuff as it was, but making it web based took it to a whole new
            level giving huge organisations visibility and control over the
            products they were producing. All in a browser!
          </p>

          <p>
            Before that, I was managing the development and implementations of
            quality control software in manufacturing environments.
