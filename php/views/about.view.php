        Creating stuff for the Internet since around 2000
        AD when I first had the idea of taking a stand-alone piece of software
        written for MS Windows&trade; onto the World Wide Web! These were fairly
        early days for the web and everything, browsers, JavaScript, CSS were in
        their infancy. The software in question was used to measure the printing
        characteristics of commercial printing presses, and subsequently provide
        a
        <em>"correction"</em> that made the press print to a defined standard.

        Employing and working with programmers to do the coding that made our
        applications 'do their stuff' and I used a very early product call
        'Frogbuilder'&trade; to build application front ends for the printing
        industry. It was created by a commpany by the name of Frogtrade&trade;
        who now specialise in eductional software:

        The applications we built were used by commercial printers to guarantee
        that their clients' final printed product would be the exact colours
        they were expecting. This was really cutting edge stuff as it was, but
        making it web based took it to a whole new level giving huge
        organisations visibility and control over the products they were
        producing. All in a browser!

        Before that, I was managing the development and implementations of
        quality control software in manufacturing environments.
